I implemented methods to fulfill the spec for scheduling. I also add functions in server.ts to connect local functions to UI.

Things did well: Scheduling performance is good. New changes didn't break much thing. UI is good 

Things to improve: Can only handle one client at a time. In order to fulfill d4 spec our class structures was getting a little bit 
of weird. It was not good design.
