3)debug in general

4. 
We use specific error number to indicate each error, which makes debug easier.

We put too strict error check because we did not fullly understand the spec, which makes our autotest fail.
In the future deliverable, we will read the spec and ask for clarification more frequently and implement error case only after we know our code is good for correct input.
