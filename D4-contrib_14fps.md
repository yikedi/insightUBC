I've implement all UI relative parts in D4. Inculding little bit Bootstrap, Ajax and lots of javascript.
Good thing about D4 is that every change we made does not break our previous work.
Bad thing about D4 is that our design has its limitation. One server with one client does not make sense at all, if we have time, we will fix this after the course ended.
